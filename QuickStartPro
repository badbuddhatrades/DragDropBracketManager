## Position Management (NEW in v2.2.0)

After placing your brackets, you have **three powerful buttons** for managing your position:

### BE +X Buttons (2 Configurable)
- **What they do**: Move your stop loss to **breakeven + X ticks**
- **Default config**: Customizable in settings (e.g., BE+1 and BE+5)
- **When to use**: Lock in profits once price moves in your favor
- **How it works**: Click button → Stop moves to entry price + X ticks instantly
- **Example**: Long ES @ 4500 → Price reaches 4515 → Click BE+1 → Stop moves to 4500.25

**Customize in Settings**: Click **⚙** → Position Management tab → Change tick values or disable either button.

### Trail X Button (Configurable)
- **What it does**: Enables a **X-tick trailing stop** that follows price
- **Default config**: Customizable in settings (e.g., 10 ticks)
- **When to use**: Let winners run while protecting gains
- **How it works**:
  - Click button (turns green when active)
  - **LONG**: Stop moves UP as price rises (stays X ticks below highest price)
  - **SHORT**: Stop moves DOWN as price falls (stays X ticks above lowest price)
  - Stop ONLY moves in favorable direction (never worse)
  - Auto-disables when position closes
- **Example**:
  - Long ES @ 4500, Trail 10 enabled
  - Price rises to 4530 → Stop moves to 4520 (10 ticks below)
  - Price drops to 4525 → Stop stays at 4520 (doesn't move down!)
  - Stopped out at 4520 for +20 point profit

**Customize in Settings**: Click **⚙** → Position Management tab → Change trailing tick amount or disable the feature.

**Pro Tip**: Combine these tools! Use BE+1 early, then enable trailing stop when you have more profit cushion.

## Real-Time Overlay (PRO Feature)

As you drag, you'll see an overlay showing:
```
R:R: 1:2
Entry: 4500.00
→ SL: 4490.00 (-10.00)
  TP: 4520.00 (+20.00)
```

- **→** arrow shows which level you're currently setting
- **Position**: Top Right, Top Left, or Follow Mouse (configurable in settings)
- **Toggle**: Enable/disable in Settings → Display tab

## Hotkeys (PRO Feature)

| Action | Hotkey | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Toggle tool on/off | **Ctrl+Shift+B** | Enable/disable bracket tool |
| Cycle R:R ratios | **Ctrl+Shift+R** | Switch between ratios |

**Cycle Order**: 1:1 → 1:2 → 1:3 → 2:1 → 3:1 → Custom → (repeat)

When you cycle ratios, you'll see:
- Toast notification showing new ratio
- Button updates to show current ratio
- Sound alert (if enabled)

## Example: Long at ES 4500

You're **long ES at 4500** and want to set brackets with 1:2 ratio:

**Method 1 - Drag to set Stop Loss**:
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** (button turns green)
- Drag DOWN to 4490
- Overlay shows: R:R 1:2, SL 4490, TP 4520
- Release
- ✓ Result: SL @ 4490, TP @ 4520 (10 risk, 20 reward)

**Method 2 - Drag to set Take Profit**:
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** (button turns green)
- Drag UP to 4520
- Overlay shows: R:R 1:2, SL 4490, TP 4520
- Release
- ✓ Result: SL @ 4490, TP @ 4520 (10 risk, 20 reward)

**Both methods work!** The overlay confirms prices before you release.

## Risk:Reward Ratios

PRO offers 6 preset ratios plus custom:

| Ratio | Meaning | Example | Best For |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| **1:1** | Equal risk/reward | Risk \$10, Make \$10 | Conservative, breakeven exits, scalping |
| **1:2** | Risk 1 to make 2 | Risk \$10, Make \$20 | **Most popular**, balanced approach |
| **1:3** | Risk 1 to make 3 | Risk \$10, Make \$30 | Aggressive, let winners run |
| **2:1** | Risk 2 to make 1 | Risk \$20, Make \$10 | Scalping with wider stops |
| **3:1** | Risk 3 to make 1 | Risk \$30, Make \$10 | Quick scalps, high win rate strategies |
| **Custom** | Your choice | Risk 1, Make 2.5 | Specific strategies requiring exact ratios |

**Switch ratios instantly**: Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** to cycle through all ratios!

**Recommended starting point**: **1:2 ratio**

## Position Scaling (Advanced)

Want to scale out of positions with **one drag**? Enable **Multiple Bracket Sets**:

### How It Works
1. Click **⚙** → **Bracket Sets** tab
2. Check **"Enable Multiple Bracket Sets"**
3. Configure your splits:
   ```
   50% @ 1:1 ratio  ← Lock in early profit
   30% @ 1:2 ratio  ← Main target
   20% @ 1:3 ratio  ← Let it run
   ```
4. Click **Save**

Now when you drag, **one motion creates all three bracket sets** automatically!

### Example
- Long 10 contracts ES @ 4500
- Drag to set risk at 10 points
- Tool places:
  - 5 contracts: SL @ 4490, TP @ 4510 (1:1)
  - 3 contracts: SL @ 4490, TP @ 4520 (1:2)
  - 2 contracts: SL @ 4490, TP @ 4530 (1:3)

**Important**: All sets share the SAME Stop Loss for full position protection.

**Benefits**:
- Lock in profits early while letting some run
- Reduce stress by securing gains
- Professional money management

## Tips for Success

### Before Trading Live
1. ✓ Test in **Sim account** first
2. ✓ Practice Long and Short drag directions
3. ✓ Try all R:R ratios to find your preference
4. ✓ Experiment with bracket sets on small positions
5. ✓ Test breakeven and trailing stop features
6. ✓ Get comfortable with hotkeys (saves time!)

### During Trading
1. ✓ Plan your trade first (know your risk level)
2. ✓ Enter position, then immediately set brackets
3. ✓ Watch overlay to confirm prices before releasing
4. ✓ Use **Ctrl+Shift+R** to quickly change ratios between trades
5. ✓ Keep tool OFF when not actively placing brackets
6. ✓ Use breakeven buttons to lock in profits as price moves
7. ✓ Enable trailing stop to let winners run

### Best Practices
- **Start simple**: Use single brackets with 1:2 ratio first
- **Master hotkeys**: Ctrl+Shift+B and Ctrl+Shift+R become second nature
- **One drag per position**: Don't place multiple brackets (creates duplicates)
- **Verify account**: Always check Chart Trader shows correct account
- **Overlay is your friend**: Confirm prices before releasing
- **Disable debug logging**: Only enable when troubleshooting
- **Save settings**: Always click Save in settings window
- **Breakeven early**: Use BE+1 as soon as price moves in your favor
- **Trail profits**: Enable trailing stop once you have good profit cushion
