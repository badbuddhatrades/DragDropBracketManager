# Drag-Drop Bracket Manager for NinjaTrader 8

**Simplify your bracket order placement with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface**

A NinjaTrader 8 addon that streamlines bracket order management by letting you visually set your stop loss and take profit levels directly on the chart with a simple drag motion. Available in both **LITE** (free) and **PRO** (paid) versions.

## What is Drag-Drop Bracket Manager?

Drag-Drop Bracket Manager transforms how you place bracket orders in NinjaTrader 8. Instead of manually calculating risk/reward ratios and entering prices, simply drag on your chart to set one level, and the tool automatically calculates the other based on your chosen risk/reward ratio.

### Perfect For
- Day traders who need quick bracket order placement
- Traders who want consistent risk management
- Anyone looking to reduce order entry errors
- Scalpers and position traders alike

---

## How It Works

1. **Enter a position** (Long or Short) in NinjaTrader
2. **Enable the tool** by clicking the button or using a hotkey (PRO)
3. **Drag on the chart** to set your level:
   - **Drag DOWN** to set your Stop Loss (Take Profit auto-calculates)
   - **Drag UP** to set your Take Profit (Stop Loss auto-calculates)
4. **Release** - Orders submit immediately with your chosen risk/reward ratio
5. Tool auto-disables for safety

### Example: Long Position at ES 4500 (1:2 R:R)

**Option 1 - Set Stop Loss by dragging down:**
- Drag to 4490 (10 points risk)
- Tool calculates TP at 4520 (20 points reward)
- Result: 1:2 ratio ✓

**Option 2 - Set Take Profit by dragging up:**
- Drag to 4520 (20 points reward)
- Tool calculates SL at 4490 (10 points risk)
- Result: 1:2 ratio ✓

Both methods give the same result - choose whichever feels more natural!
